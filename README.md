# X99-EFI-Folder-Distributions

1.) EFI-Folder distributions valid for ASUS X99-A II with patched BIOS Firware for MSR register kernel write. 

For mainbaords with locked MSR register, check KernelPM and enable _xcpm_core_scope_msrs Â© Pike R. Alpha Kernel patch in config.plist - Section "Kernel and Kext Patches" of Clover Configurator 

2.) EFI-Folder distributions valid for Broadwell/Broadwell-E

For use with Haswell/Haswell-E CPUs, change FakeCPUID from 0x040674 to 0x0306F2 in config.plist - Section "Kernel and Kext Patches" of Clover Configurator. _

xcpm_bootstrap Kernel patch seems still required for some fo the Haswell-E CPUs, e.g. i7-5820k. For most Broadwell-E CPUs, _xcpm_cpuid_set_info and _xcpm_bootstrap Kernel patches are obsolete and can remain disabled.

In any case note that the implemented but disabled 

# _xcpm_cpuid_set_info 

Find: 723cd077 500fb6c0
Replace: 6a3cd077 500fb6c0 

and 

# _xcpm_bootstrap 

Find: 89d804c4 3c227722
Replace:89d804c3 3c227722 

Kernel patches are for Broadwell-E!

For Haswell-E change to:

# _xcpm_cpuid_set_info 

Find: 723cd077 500fb6c0
Replace: 6f3cd077 500fb6c0 

# xcpm_bootstrap 

Find: 89d804c4 3c227722
Replace:89d804c1 3c227722
